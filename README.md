GoldenOculus
============

My attempt at recreating the 007 Goldeneye multiplayer map and gameplay.

## Maps

* [Multiplayer Level: Library Stacks](http://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/197462-goldeneye-007/faqs/47195)
* [Multiplayer Level: Library Basement](http://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/197462-goldeneye-007/faqs/46139)

## Credits

A big thank you goes out to [Team GoldenEye: Source](http://www.moddb.com/company/goldeneye-source-developers),
developers of the excellent HL2 mod [GoldenEye: Source](http://www.moddb.com/mods/goldeneye-source),
for the use of many of their assets in this demo. Without you, this project probably would have foundered.
